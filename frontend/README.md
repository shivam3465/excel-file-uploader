<!-- # React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh -->

Setup :


(be sure that you have node installed in your system )

for checking whether the node is installed on your system or not run the following command

node -v

(if you get a version something like v16.16.0 then it means node is installed on your system else install node for your system from any browser)

if you have node installed then move to the root directory of the this folder and then run the following command

npm install
npm start

this will start the web application in your browser and if not then you will see the link in the terminal just click on the link with holding control key which will open the web application in your browser. 

!! Ands thats all you need to do !!
